# ISP Micropublication Template

This repo contains a template for creating Impact Scholars Program micropublications using [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/).

For a complete tutorial, read [Authoring an ISP micropublication](https://open-scholar-nexus.github.io/oaktree-sapling/isp-intro)

## Quick setup

If you're familiar with the tools involved, these few steps are all you need. We expect you to have a working conda/mamba setup. For guidance on this, see the [Conda/Mamba Tutorial](https://open-scholar-nexus.github.io/oaktree-sapling/conda-tutorial).


1. Install MyST Markdown using the provided environment file:

   ```bash
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   mamba activate isp-paper
   ```

1. Edit your content in `index.md`
1. Add your figure (replace `figure.png`)
1. Update `myst.yml`
1. Replace the thumbnail in `thumbnails/thumbnail.png` for the gallery display
1. **Preview locally**:
   - While you're working on the paper, the best option is to run `myst start`
   - Before pushing, check that the static build (more detail in optional reading) is working as expected

   ```bash
   myst build --typst && myst build --html && npx serve _build/html
   ```
1. Update this README.md: include any information that someone reaching the repository may need. You can keep this README if you prefer, it won't be rendered.

## File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
